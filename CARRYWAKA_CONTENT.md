• Transaction Data: Details about payments, escrow transactions, and delivery history.

3. How We Use Your Data

• Facilitate deliveries and match users based on routes.
• Verify identities to ensure the safety of our community.
• Process secure escrow payments and payouts.
• Communicate important updates and support messages.

14. TERMS & CONDITIONS
1. Acceptance of Terms
By downloading, accessing, or using the CarryWaka app and website, you agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.

2. Service Description
CarryWaka is a peer-to-peer delivery platform that connects Senders with Carriers who are already traveling in the same direction. We are not a traditional courier or logistics company; we act as a technology facilitator.

3. User Obligations
• You must be at least 18 years old to use the service.
• You agree to provide accurate and truthful information during verification.
• Senders: You must not send prohibited items (illegal goods, cash, dangerous materials).
• Carriers: You must deliver items safely and in the same condition they were received.

4. Payments
Your money stays safe until the delivery is complete. After that, the sender pays the carrier directly. The carrier pays CarryWaka’s commission through the app once it reaches ₦1,000.

5. Liability
While we verify carriers to maintain high safety standards, CarryWaka is not liable for indirect or consequential losses. Our support team will mediate disputes in accordance with our community guidelines.

6. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
